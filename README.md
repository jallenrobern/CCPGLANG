#ðŸ¥˜ PAN Analyzer â€” A Cooking-Inspired Programming Language (Cook++)
ðŸ“– Project Overview

PAN Analyzer is a lexical and syntax analyzer for Cook++, a recipe-inspired programming language designed to teach basic programming concepts through cooking metaphors.
The language transforms everyday cooking instructions like mix, chop, and bake into structured programming statements that represent functions, control flow, and expressions.

This project demonstrates how a domain-specific language (DSL) can make programming more intuitive and engaging for beginners.
