# 🥘 PAN Analyzer for Cook++

## Project Title
**Cook++: A Mini Programming Language for Cooking Recipes**  
**Tool:** PAN Analyzer (Parser and Syntax Checker)  
**Language Used:** Python  

---

## Overview
Cook++ is a domain-specific programming language designed to represent cooking instructions in a structured and programmable way.  
The **PAN Analyzer** serves as the syntax analyzer that validates Cook++ programs, ensuring that each statement follows the language’s grammar rules.

**Input:** A Cook++ source code file (`.cook` or `.txt`)  
**Output:** A message indicating whether the syntax is valid or showing detailed error messages with line numbers.

## How to Run the Analyzer

### Step 1: Open the Notebook
Open the file `syntax_analyzer_v3.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.

### Step 2: Run All Cells
Execute all code cells in order.  
If the analyzer initializes successfully, you will see a message like:  
> Server running... PAN Analyzer is ready.

### Step 3: Test Your Cook++ Program
Enter your Cook++ code into the analyzer input field, or modify the provided sample program.

#### Example Input:
```cook
procedure lutongUlam(sangkap) {
    chop sangkap;
    fry sangkap 10;
    mix;
    return;
}

lutongUlam(gulay);
serve;
```

## Sample Test Programs

You may test using these examples:

- **test1_basic.cook** → Simple cooking actions  
- **test2_procedure.cook** → Procedure and function call  
- **test3_ifelse.cook** → Conditional statements  
- **test4_loop.cook** → Loop structures  
- **test5_combined.cook** → Full recipe with variables, loops, and conditionals  

Each test covers one or more grammar features.
